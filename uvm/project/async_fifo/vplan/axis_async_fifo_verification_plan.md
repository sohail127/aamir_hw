# AXIS Asynchronous FIFO Verification Plan

## 1. AXIS Protocol Compliance Tests

### 1.1 Handshaking
- Verify correct handshaking on slave interface (s_axis_tvalid and s_axis_tready)
- Verify correct handshaking on master interface (m_axis_tvalid and m_axis_tready)

### 1.2 Data Transfer
- Verify data (tdata) is transferred correctly
- Verify byte strobes (tstrb) are handled correctly
- Verify last signal (tlast) is propagated correctly

### 1.3 Backpressure Handling
- Test FIFO behavior when m_axis_tready is deasserted
- Verify s_axis_tready is deasserted when FIFO is full

## 2. AXIS Packet Handling

### 2.1 Single Packet Transfer
- Write and read a single packet (from tlast to tlast)
- Verify packet integrity and order

### 2.2 Multiple Packet Transfer
- Write multiple packets and read them back
- Verify each packet's integrity and order

### 2.3 Partial Packet Transfer
- Write partial packets across FIFO full/empty conditions
- Verify correct reassembly of packets

## 3. AXIS-Specific Corner Cases

### 3.1 Zero-length Packets
- Test handling of packets with only tlast asserted

### 3.2 Maximum-length Packets
- Test packets that fill the entire FIFO

### 3.3 Strobe Patterns
- Test various tstrb patterns, including all zeros and all ones

## 4. Functionality Tests

### 4.1 Basic Operations
- Write and read a single data item
- Write multiple items and read them back in order
- Verify FIFO maintains FIFO order

### 4.2 Boundary Conditions
- Write until full, then read until empty
- Read from an empty FIFO
- Write to a full FIFO

### 4.3 Flag Tests
- Verify 'almost_empty' flag is set/cleared correctly
- Verify 'almost_full' flag is set/cleared correctly
- Check flags during concurrent read/write operations

## 5. Clock Domain Crossing Tests

### 5.1 Different Clock Frequencies
- Test with write clock faster than read clock
- Test with read clock faster than write clock
- Test with significantly different clock frequencies (e.g., 10x difference)

### 5.2 Clock Domain Synchronization
- Verify correct operation across clock domains
- Check for metastability issues

## 6. Reset Tests

### 6.1 Asynchronous Reset
- Apply reset while FIFO is empty
- Apply reset while FIFO is partially full
- Apply reset while FIFO is full
- Verify all internal states and AXIS signals are correctly initialized after reset

### 6.2 Reset Timing
- Apply reset for varying durations
- Apply reset close to clock edges

## 7. Timing Tests

### 7.1 Setup and Hold Times
- Verify data and control signals are correctly captured on write
- Verify data and control signals are correctly output on read

### 7.2 Clock Skew
- Introduce clock skew between read and write clocks
- Verify correct operation under maximum specified clock skew

## 8. Parameterization Tests

### 8.1 Data Width
- Test with minimum data width (e.g., 8 bits)
- Test with maximum supported data width
- Test with odd data widths

### 8.2 FIFO Depth
- Test with minimum depth (e.g., 4 entries)
- Test with maximum supported depth
- Test with non-power-of-2 depths (if supported)

## 9. Performance Tests

### 9.1 Throughput
- Measure maximum sustained write throughput
- Measure maximum sustained read throughput
- Measure throughput under various fill levels and backpressure conditions

### 9.2 Latency
- Measure write-to-read latency
- Measure latency under different clock ratios and AXIS traffic patterns

## 10. Error Injection and Recovery

### 10.1 Data Corruption
- Inject errors in the FIFO memory
- Verify error detection and handling (if implemented)

### 10.2 Clock Glitches
- Introduce clock glitches on read clock
- Introduce clock glitches on write clock

## 11. Stress Tests

### 11.1 Long-running Tests
- Continuous operation with varying AXIS traffic patterns
- Alternating read/write patterns for long durations

### 11.2 Randomized Tests
- Random read/write patterns with varying packet sizes
- Random clock frequency changes (if supported)
- Random assertion/deassertion of tready signals

## 12. Coverage

### 12.1 Functional Coverage
- Define and measure coverage for all AXIS signals and their combinations
- Cover various fill levels of the FIFO

### 12.2 Code Coverage
- Aim for 100% code coverage (line, branch, toggle, FSM)

## 13. Formal Verification

### 13.1 Properties
- Define and verify key properties (e.g., no data loss, correct ordering, AXIS compliance)

### 13.2 Assertions
- Implement and verify assertions for critical behaviors and AXIS protocol rules
