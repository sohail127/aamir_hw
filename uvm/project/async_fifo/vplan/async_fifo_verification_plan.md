# Asynchronous FIFO Verification Plan

## 1. Functionality Tests

### 1.1 Basic Operations
- Write and read a single data item
- Write multiple items and read them back in order
- Verify FIFO maintains FIFO order

### 1.2 Boundary Conditions
- Write until full, then read until empty
- Read from an empty FIFO
- Write to a full FIFO

### 1.3 Flag Tests
- Verify 'empty' flag is set/cleared correctly
- Verify 'full' flag is set/cleared correctly
- Check flags during concurrent read/write operations

## 2. Clock Domain Crossing Tests

### 2.1 Different Clock Frequencies
- Test with write clock faster than read clock
- Test with read clock faster than write clock
- Test with significantly different clock frequencies (e.g., 10x difference)

### 2.2 Clock Domain Synchronization
- Verify correct operation across clock domains
- Check for metastability issues

## 3. Reset Tests

### 3.1 Asynchronous Reset
- Apply reset while FIFO is empty
- Apply reset while FIFO is partially full
- Apply reset while FIFO is full
- Verify all internal states are correctly initialized after reset

### 3.2 Reset Timing
- Apply reset for varying durations
- Apply reset close to clock edges

## 4. Timing Tests

### 4.1 Setup and Hold Times
- Verify data is correctly captured on write
- Verify data is correctly output on read

### 4.2 Clock Skew
- Introduce clock skew between read and write clocks
- Verify correct operation under maximum specified clock skew

## 5. Parameterization Tests

### 5.1 Data Width
- Test with minimum data width (e.g., 1 bit)
- Test with maximum supported data width
- Test with odd data widths

### 5.2 FIFO Depth
- Test with minimum depth (e.g., 2 entries)
- Test with maximum supported depth
- Test with non-power-of-2 depths (if supported)

## 6. Corner Case Tests

### 6.1 Simultaneous Operations
- Simultaneous read and write when empty
- Simultaneous read and write when full
- Rapid toggling of read and write enables

### 6.2 Pointer Wrap-around
- Verify correct operation when write pointer wraps around
- Verify correct operation when read pointer wraps around
- Test multiple wrap-arounds

## 7. Performance Tests

### 7.1 Throughput
- Measure maximum sustained write throughput
- Measure maximum sustained read throughput
- Measure throughput under various fill levels

### 7.2 Latency
- Measure write-to-read latency
- Measure latency under different clock ratios

## 8. Error Injection and Recovery

### 8.1 Data Corruption
- Inject errors in the FIFO memory
- Verify error detection and handling (if implemented)

### 8.2 Clock Glitches
- Introduce clock glitches on read clock
- Introduce clock glitches on write clock

## 9. Power Management Tests

### 9.1 Clock Gating
- Verify correct operation with clock gating on read clock
- Verify correct operation with clock gating on write clock

### 9.2 Power-down and Wake-up
- Test FIFO behavior during power-down sequences
- Test FIFO behavior during wake-up sequences

## 10. Compliance and Integration Tests

### 10.1 Protocol Compliance
- Verify compliance with relevant interface standards (if any)

### 10.2 Integration
- Test FIFO in the context of larger system integration
- Verify correct interaction with other system components

## 11. Stress Tests

### 11.1 Long-running Tests
- Continuous operation for extended periods
- Alternating read/write patterns for long durations

### 11.2 Randomized Tests
- Random read/write patterns
- Random clock frequency changes (if supported)

## 12. Coverage

### 12.1 Functional Coverage
- Define and measure coverage for all functional aspects

### 12.2 Code Coverage
- Aim for 100% code coverage (line, branch, toggle, FSM)

## 13. Formal Verification

### 13.1 Properties
- Define and verify key properties (e.g., no data loss, correct ordering)

### 13.2 Assertions
- Implement and verify assertions for critical behaviors
